# YACA - Yet Another Crypto API

YACA is a simple, yet powerful wrapper for the OpenSSL library. It
wraps common and most widely used cryptographic operations in a simple
and easy to use API.

See `main.rs` file for a quick example.

`tests` directory contains more tests/examples for all available APIs.

All public API are documented in rustdoc.
